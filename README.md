# About Me App

This application, developed as the second project during the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course at Udacity, aims to showcase some personal information such as my academic journey, goals, and hobbies. 
 The app features an EditText where users can input their nickname. Upon clicking the "Done" button, a greeting message is displayed along with my bio.

## Overview

The app is built using Kotlin and utilizes the Android Data Binding library to update the UI dynamically.
The layout is structured with a ScrollView containing a TextView that displays the bio information.
